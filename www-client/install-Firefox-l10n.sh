# The packages are expected to be in the same directory this script is in.
# It exports USE with all of the possible languages to make sure all
# of the language packages are installed properly (so that it does not matter
# what is set in make.conf). Note that it may not work with pkgcore!

# Options: --pkgcore - use pkgcore (but see note above),
#          --ebuild-install - use the ebuild command,
#          --eit-inject - build a binary package using Portage and inject
#                         with eit
#          -- PM_OPTS - pass options to the package manager (default: --ask),
#                       ignored with --ebuild-install; with --eit-inject used
#                       for building part only
